# GUI Unifyer: Unified

## What is this?
**GUI Unifyer Unified** is a Factorio mod that standardizes the appearance of mod buttons, making them uniform, aligned, and visually consistent. This mod harmonizes most of the in-game icons, ensuring a cleaner and more organized interface.

Originally known as **Gui Unifyer**, by **snouz**, which was inspired by **Better Modbuttons** by Dr_Pepper. After years without updates and the release of **Factorio 2.0**, the mod was in need of resurrection‚Äîand here it is, reincarnated for Factorio 2.0 and Space Age.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Currently, there is no clean way to uninstall the mod from an existing save. Doing so may leave behind empty icons.
