# GUI Unifier

## What is this?
**GUI Unifier** is a Factorio mod that standardizes the appearance of mod buttons, making them uniform, aligned, and visually consistent. This mod harmonizes most of the modded buttons, ensuring a cleaner and more organized interface.

> üöÄ The mod has been refactored and updated to fix numerous bugs and work with **Factorio 2.0** by Solus Caelum, and is now known as **GUI Unifier**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Currently, there is no clean way to uninstall the mod from an existing save. Doing so may leave behind empty icons.
